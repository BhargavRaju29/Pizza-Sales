Pizza Sales 

This project is a data analysis project focused on pizza sales data. The goal is to gain insights into pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and other relevant information that can be valuable for a pizza restaurant or delivery.

It is done using Tableau, SQL and Python.

The dataset we have described contains information related to pizza orders. It includes four tables in CSV format, and here's a brief overview of each of them:



Orders Table:
Contains date and time information for all the orders placed. This table likely records when each customer placed an order for pizza.

Order Details Table:
Contains details about the different pizzas served with each order from the Orders table. This table may include information about the specific pizzas ordered and the quantities of each type.

Pizzas Table:
Contains information about the pizzas offered, including details like size, price, and the broader category to which each pizza belongs. It likely includes distinct pizza variations available for customers.

Pizza Types Table:
Provides information about the different pizza types listed in the Pizzas table. This information may include the name of each pizza as it appears on the menu, the category it falls under (e.g., vegetarian, meat lovers, etc.), and possibly a list of ingredients used to make each pizza.
